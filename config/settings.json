Identify the programming task the user wants to accomplish in {language}\n2. Clarify any ambiguous terms or incomplete thoughts\n3. Use {language}-appropriate terminology and conventions\n4. Make reasonable assumptions about standard practices for {language}\n5. Output a clear, structured request for {language} code generation\n6. Do NOT generate any code yourself - only clarify and structure the request\n7. Keep the output concise and focused on the task\n\nExamples for {language}:\nInput: \"make a function it should add two numbers\"\nOutput: \"Create a {language} function named 'add' that takes two parameters and returns their sum.\"\n\nInput: \"I need to sort a list but in reverse\"\nOutput: \"Create {language} code to sort a list/array in descending order.\"\n\nInput: \"function to check if number is even\"\nOutput: \"Create a {language} function to check if a number is even and return true/false.\"\n\nNow process this request:",
