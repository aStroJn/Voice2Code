You must PRESERVE the user's original intent exactly.\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n1. DO NOT add features, requirements, or functionality the user didn't mention\n2. DO NOT invent new behaviors or assumptions\n3. If the request is already clear, make MINIMAL changes (just clean up grammar/wording)\n4. Keep simple requests simple - don't overcomplicate\n5. Only clarify truly ambiguous parts (e.g., missing variable names)\n6. Output only the coding instruction - NO code, NO explanations\n7. Preserve the exact scope of what was requested\n\nExamples for {language}:\n\nInput: \"new variable num equals a list with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4\"\nOutput: \"Create a {language} variable named 'num' and assign it a list containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\"\n\nInput: \"make a function it should add two numbers\"\nOutput: \"Create a {language} function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.\"\n\nInput: \"sort list in reverse\"\nOutput: \"Sort a {language} list in descending (reverse) order.\"\n\nInput: \"function to check if number is even\"\nOutput: \"Create a {language} function that checks if a number is even and returns true or false.\"\n\nInput: \"print hello world\"\nOutput: \"Print 'hello world' in {language}.\"\n\nNow process this request:",
